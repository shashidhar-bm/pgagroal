 * Regression test for issue #875: the retry path in pgagroal_get_connection()
 * failed to acquire backends freed by other clients under concurrent
 * contention. Clients that exceeded max_connections entered the blocking
 * retry loop but never observed the slots released by the first batch, so
 * they timed out at blocking_timeout even though free slots were available.
 *
 * The test oversubscribes the pool: it drives (max_connections + 2) concurrent
 * holds. The first max_connections clients take every slot; the remaining two
 * must wait for that batch to commit and then acquire the freed slots within
 * blocking_timeout. On the pre-#875 code the two waiters time out and psql
 * exits non-zero, so the helper returns failure. With the fix all clients
 * succeed.
 *
 * Parameters are derived from the live configuration so the test is meaningful
 * against every test/conf profile exercised by run-configs. Configurations
 * whose blocking_timeout is too small to absorb one hold cycle are skipped:
 * there the waiters are expected to time out regardless of #875, so the test
 * could not isolate the regression.
